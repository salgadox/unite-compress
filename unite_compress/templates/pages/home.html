    <h1>File Compression Tool</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our file compression tool! With this tool, you can compress images, videos, PDFs, and soon PowerPoint presentations. Here's how to use it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select or drag the file you want to compress by clicking on the "Choose File" button.</li>
      <li>Select the compression level you want to use. Higher compression levels result in smaller files, but can take longer to compress and decompress.</li>
      <li>Click on the "Compress File" button to start the compression process.</li>
      <li>Once the compression is complete, you can download the compressed file by clicking on the "Download" button.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: For PowerPoint presentations, the tool will first convert them to PDF format and then compress them.</p>
